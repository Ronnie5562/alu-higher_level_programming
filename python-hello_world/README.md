### Facilitator Disclamer
```
Welcome to the Python world!

The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.
You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same
thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations. Like
C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won't start
off with using PyCode, because it's much more strict compared to PEP8. Don't worry if you see a warning when you are
running PEP8, you can ignore it.
Enjoy!
